Rules of 21:
The game plays similar to Blackjack: the players take turns choosing 
to "draw"(receive another card) or "stay" (retain their current cards and 
pass their turn to the opponent). When both players "stay" in succession, 
the cards are revealed. The winner is whoever has the cards with 
a total value closest to 21 without going over. If a player goes beyond 21 
he automatically loses.

Rules of Blackjack:
The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until 
the end. To 'draw' is to ask for another card. To 'stay' is to hold your total
and end your turn. If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless 
of the dealer's hand. If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got 
a blackjack.
